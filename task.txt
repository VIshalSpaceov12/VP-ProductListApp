Task:
Develop a React Native application that displays the content from the provided array in a list format.
Requirements:
Responsive Layout (Orientation-based):
In portrait mode: Display items in one column.
In landscape mode: Display items in two columns.
Sorting:
Include a "Sort by Price" button.
First tap: Sort items in ascending order.
Second tap: Sort items in descending order.
Third tap: Reset the item order.
Search:
Add a search bar.
Filter items in real-time by matching:
title
any value inside tags
Note: The search should trigger only when a minimum of 3 letters are entered.
Multi-Select & Delete:
Allow selecting multiple items (via checkboxes or toggles).
Include a "Delete Selected" button to remove selected items from the list.
Expectations:
Demonstrates usage of React Native components and hooks.
Manages orientation/layout changes.
Uses efficient list rendering.
Handles search, sort, and selection states effectively.

When deleting items, ensure that the search function only filters through the updated list of items (i.e., search should only apply to the remaining items after deletion).
